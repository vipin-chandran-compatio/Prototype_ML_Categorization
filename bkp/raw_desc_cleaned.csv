galvan torque reel galvan torque reel  as the premier reel in the galvan range  the torque series reels represent the culmination of a lifetime of fly fishing and passion for reel design  simply stated  it represents the very best of modern fly reel architecture  the torque reel series was created because boni wanted to create a revolutionary reel with a more substantial drag system than was presently available on the market  and it had to be sexy  thus the torque series reels were born  the visually striking appearance of the torque reels is a result of the unique cut outs on the frame  spool  drag knob and reel foot  this design is not only aesthetic but also structural as it significantly reduces the weight of the reel while maintaining strength and increasing rigidity  the rounded rims on both spool and frame enhance durability to better withstand impact during extreme angling conditions  at first glance  the hand is drawn to the reel and from the first crank of the contoured counter balanced spool  the reel s quality is apparent  it is a combination of efficiency and simplicity driven by function  in this case  less is more and cost is no exception as torque reels retail at half the price of reels in its class  torque series reels are saltwater safe and will perform flawlessly under the harshest conditions  from remote alpine lakes to the saltwater flats  the highly ventilated spool and frame balance nicely with the lightest of today s fly rods yet still compliment a modern big game saltwater fly rod  the torque is tough as nails and skillfully marries the technology of the future with the tradition of the past  model   dia width weight line wts line capacity yards backing backing reel price spool price t                   oz      wf     wf      yd      yd    lb                 t                    oz      wf     wf       yd      yd    lb                 t                   oz      wf     wf       yd       yd    lb                 t                   oz      wf     wf       yd       yd    lb                 t                    oz    wf       yd    lb                 t                     oz     wf        yd    lb                 t                    oz     wf        yd    lb
